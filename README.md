# pcpu v2.1
PCPU is 16 bit RISC processor, running designed from scratch architecture.

Educational project, created because I wanted to know how CPUs work. Starting from simple 8 bit processor in logic simulator, now it is more advanced v2 CPU running on real FPGA hardware, with future plans to create simple operating system for it.
